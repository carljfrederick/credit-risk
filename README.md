## Technologies

This application leverages Python 3.7 with the following libraries and dependencies:

Pandas: Python library for data analysis and manipulation

Numpy: Python library for mathematical functions

scikit-learn: Python machine learning library

pathlib: Python filesystem module

imbalanced-learn: Open source library that provides tools when dealing with classification with imbalanced classes.
